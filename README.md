# Underhand
An unofficial continuation to the app [Underhand](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.cornell.gdiac.underhand).
I used the app as reference to create this desktop version of the game.

<h1>How to open in Unity</h1>

To open the project in Unity - 

1) clone the project to an empty folder.
2) open with one of these ways:
    - Open the project with unity hub. Click Open and navigate where the project was cloned.
    OR
    - File>Open Project>navigate where the project was cloned.
3) you can click play and the game will Start.

<h2>Build the Game</h2>

1) go to the addressables window (Window>Asset Manager>Addressables>Groups)
2) Press on build (takes about 10-30 seconds for me)
3) than File>Build Setting>Build and choose where to build the Game.

<h2>What is in the Game?</h2>

everything! except...
1)  the game menu is not done yet, it contains only The Game and mute in options.

<h2>Added</h2>

1) Added another God - Sulucnumoh
2) Mode 2 is in development.
    I am more of a developer than a designer, so art is quite difficult for me, I hope it won't tale too long.
3) Added 2 more gods, Lepudeus and Anatideus.
    They yet to have blessings.
    
    
 I was surprised to discover how hard it to add art to the new cards, it halted almost entirely my progress, hope i will continue soon.


<h2>Vision(Future Expectations)</h2>

1) Add More Gods to the game.
2) Add cheerful mode of fighting the cultist plan to revive the gods.

Any suggestion will be great.

have fun :).
