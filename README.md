# Underhand
An unofficial continuation to the app [Underhand](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.cornell.gdiac.underhand).
I used the app as reference to create this desktop version of the game.

<h1>How to open in Unity</h1>

To open the project in Unity - 

1) clone the project to an empty folder.
2) open with one of these ways:
    - Open the project with unity hub. Click Open and navigate where the project was cloned.
    OR
    - File>Open Project>navigate where the project was cloned.
3) you can click play and the game will Start.

<h2>Build the Game</h2>

1) go to the addressables window (Window>Asset Manager>Addressables>Groups)
2) Press on build (takes about 10-30 seconds for me)
3) than File>Build Setting>Build and choose where to build the Game.

<h2>What is in the Game?</h2>

everything! except...
1)  the game menu is not done yet, it contains only The Game and mute in options.
2)  all god's blessing cards are all in the deck and not like the app, where you can choose up to 3 god's blessing,this will be implemented in the future.

<h2>Vision(Future Expectations</h2>

1) Add Gods to the game.
2) add cheerful mode of fighting the cultist plan to revive the gods.

Any suggestion will be great.

have fun :).
